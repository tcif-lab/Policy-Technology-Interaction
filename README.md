# Policy-Tech Mining for EV Battery Recycling

## üîç Overview

This project introduces a structured, computational approach to analyze the interaction between public policy and technological innovation, specifically in the context of Electric Vehicle (EV) battery recycling in China. We propose and implement the **Policy‚ÄìTechnology Interaction Matrix (PTIM)**, a seven-step methodology combining patent text mining, policy document analysis, and BM25-based term relevance scoring.

## üß† Key Contributions

- Development of the **PTIM**, a systematic matrix that maps policies to specific EV battery recycling technologies.
- Integration of patent and policy data using **text mining and similarity-based thresholding**.
- Implementation of **BM25 scoring** to assess term relevance across patents and policies.
- Demonstration of the methodology using Chinese EV battery recycling data (2011‚Äì2024).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Code

### 1. Environment Setup  
Make sure you have Python ‚â• 3.8 installed. Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
```

### 2. Start Jupyter Notebook  
Launch the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook EDA_code+TFM_code.ipynb
```

### 3. Execution Flow  
- Load and clean datasets.  
- Construct the technology and policy term libraries.  
- Compute BM25-based similarity scores.  
- Generate the Policy‚ÄìTechnology Interaction Matrix (PTIM).  
- Visualize results and rankings.
