"T11 An electric battery is a source of electric power consisting of one or more electrochemical cells with external connections for powering electrical devices. When a battery is supplying power, its positive terminal is the cathode and its negative terminal is the anode. The terminal marked negative is the source of electrons. When a battery is connected to an external electric load, those negatively charged electrons flow through the circuit and reach to the positive terminal, thus cause a redox reaction by attracting positively charged ions, cations. Thus converts high-energy reactants to lower-energy products, and the free-energy difference is delivered to the external circuit as electrical energy. Historically the term ""battery"" specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells; however, the usage has evolved to include devices composed of a single cell. 

Primary (single-use or ""disposable"") batteries are used once and discarded, as the electrode materials are irreversibly changed during discharge; a common example is the alkaline battery used for flashlights and a multitude of portable electronic devices. Secondary (rechargeable) batteries can be discharged and recharged multiple times using an applied electric current; the original composition of the electrodes can be restored by reverse current. Examples include the lead–acid batteries used in vehicles and lithium-ion batteries used for portable electronics such as laptops and mobile phones.

Batteries come in many shapes and sizes, from miniature cells used to power hearing aids and wristwatches to, at the largest extreme, huge battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby or emergency power for telephone exchanges and computer data centers. Batteries have much lower specific energy (energy per unit mass) than common fuels such as gasoline. In automobiles, this is somewhat offset by the higher efficiency of electric motors in converting electrical energy to mechanical work, compared to combustion engines."
"T12 Battery refers to the part of a cup, tank, or other container or composite container containing an electrolyte solution and a metal electrode to generate an electric current, and a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. There are positive and negative poles. With the advancement of science and technology, batteries generally refer to small devices that can generate electricity. Such as solar cells. The performance parameters of the battery mainly include electromotive force, capacity, specific energy and resistance. Using the battery as an energy source, you can get a stable voltage, stable current, long-term stable power supply, little external influence of the current, and the battery has a simple structure, easy to carry, easy to charge and discharge operation, not affected by the external climate and temperature, stable and reliable performance, in all aspects of modern social life play a great role."
"T13 An electric battery is defined as a device that makes use of either one or an assembly of electrochemical cells that convert the stored chemical energy within them into electrical energy. Each cell has a positive terminal, cathode, and a negative terminal, anode."
"T14 An electric vehicle battery is a rechargeable battery used to power the electric motors of a battery electric vehicle (BEV) or hybrid electric vehicle (HEV).

They are typically lithium-ion batteries that are designed for high power-to-weight ratio and energy density. Compared to liquid fuels, most current battery technologies have much lower specific energy. This increases the weight of vehicles or reduces their range.

Li-NMC batteries using lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides are the most common in EV. The lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) is on the rise, reaching 41% global market share by capacity for BEVs in 2023. LFP batteries are heavier but cheaper and more sustainable. At the same time, the first commercial passenger cars are using a sodium-ion battery (Na-ion) completely avoiding the need for critical minerals.

The battery makes up a significant portion of the cost and environmental impact of an electric vehicle. Growth in the industry has generated interest in securing ethical battery supply chains, which presents many challenges and has become an important geopolitical issue. Reduction of use of mined cobalt, which is also required in fossil fuel refining, has been a major goal of research. A number of new chemistries compete to displace Li-NMC with performance above 800Wh/kg in laboratory testing.

As of December 2019, despite more reliance on recycled materials, the cost of electric vehicle batteries has fallen 87% since 2010 on a per kilowatt-hour basis.

Demand for EVBs exceeded 750 GWh in 2023. EVBs have much higher capacities than automotive batteries used for starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI) in combustion cars. The average battery capacity of available EV models reached from 21 to 123 kWh in 2023 with an average of 80 kWh."
