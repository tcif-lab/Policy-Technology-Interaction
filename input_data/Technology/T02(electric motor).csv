"T21 A Motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. It uses an electrified coil (that is, the stator winding) to generate a rotating magnetic field and is applied to the rotor (such as a squirrel-cage closed aluminum frame) to form magnetoelectric rotational torque. Motors are divided into DC motors and AC motors according to the use of different power supplies, and most of the motors in the power system are AC motors, which can be synchronous motors or asynchronous motors (motor stator magnetic field speed and rotor rotation speed do not maintain synchronous speed). The motor is mainly composed of stator and rotor, and the direction of force movement of the energized wire in the magnetic field is related to the direction of the current and the direction of the magnetic induction line (magnetic field direction). The working principle of the motor is the action of the magnetic field on the current force, so that the motor rotates."
"T22 An electric motor is a machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor’s magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of torque applied on the motor’s shaft. An electric generator is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates in reverse, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.

Electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as from batteries or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC) sources, such as a power grid, inverters or electrical generators.

Electric motors may be classified by considerations such as power source type, construction, application and type of motion output. They can be brushed or brushless, single-phase, two-phase, or three-phase, axial or radial flux, and may be air-cooled or liquid-cooled.

Standardized motors provide power for industrial use. The largest are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and pumped-storage applications, with output exceeding 100 megawatts.

Applications include industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, vehicles, and disk drives. Small motors may be found in electric watches. In certain applications, such as in regenerative braking with traction motors, electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that might otherwise be lost as heat and friction.

Electric motors produce linear or rotary force (torque) intended to propel some external mechanism. This makes them a type of actuator. They are generally designed for continuous rotation, or for linear movement over a significant distance compared to its size. Solenoids also convert electrical power to mechanical motion, but over only a limited distance."
"T23 An electric motor is a type of device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, typically by utilizing electromagnetic phenomena. Most electric motors generate mechanical torque through the interaction of conductors carrying current at right angles to a magnetic field. Different types of electric motors vary in how the conductors and the magnetic field are arranged, as well as in the control mechanisms that regulate mechanical output, including torque, speed, and position. The primary types of electric motors are outlined in detail below."
